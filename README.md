## About the Project

ClassChat is an innovative open-invitation chat service that allows anyone in the school to hop in and chat with other people.

The project was created using Java EE (JSP/Servlet) with WebSocket and MySQL, as well with CSS and JavaScript.
This project utilizes the well-known MVC model.


#### Who is this project for?

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools have switched to online learning systems. Due to the lack of physical interactions, however, many students worldwide are unable to communicate and socialize with their classmates in school, and therefore having trouble finding friends or asking questions about their homework. This is especially worse for transfer students who have changed schools during the pandemic. Since they don't know anyone in their new schools, they are rarely invited to private group chats, so they often end up being isolated from their peers.

ClassChat can provide a great opportunity for students worldwide to communicate in the midst of this virus pandemic. Our open-invitation chat system allow anyone to join any group chat in the same school and socialize with their peers anywhere and anytime. 

ClassChat can still be an effective service after the COVID-19 pandemic. It will allow students to ask their classmates about a course's homework, project, or test regardless of the pandemic.
